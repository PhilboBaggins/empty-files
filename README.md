# Zero files

This repository contains several files, of various sizes, which are full of zeros.

These files are useful for testing purposes or for zeroing out a disk (e.g on Windows, when you don't have easy access to the `dd` command).

To safe disk space, the files are stored in a compressed format. So, when writing them to a disk, you'll need to decompress them first or use a program that automatically decompresses them while writing them to the disk.
